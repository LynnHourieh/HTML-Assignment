      <h2>How Does Coding Work?</h2>
      <p>Computer <b>code</b> is very important. Almost every electronic device you use relies on <b>code</b>. The way things work can seem quite confusing, but when you break it down it's actually simple.<br><br>

        People who make <b>code</b> are called programmers, coders or developers. They all work with computers to create websites, apps, and even games! Today you'll learn what <b>code</b> it, what it's for, and how to start learning <b>code</b> yourself.</p>

<h2>Interesting Question:
    <br>
</h2>
<h3>Is Coding Hard?</h3>
<p>Coding can be very simple, and anyone can learn the basics. A good analogy is to think of coding like books in a library.<br> Some books use simple language, and the stories are easy to understand. Others use very complex words and have stories that seem to make no sense. Whether they are simple or hard to read, they are all books.</p>
